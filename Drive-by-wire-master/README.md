# DriveByWire

This repository is for use with the **Drive by Wire** board created to be used for the ELCANO self-driving tricycle. In order for this module to run external libraries are required.

Repositories were updated 6/8/2023 but clobbered previous history. Chief addition is use of an RC controller that allows manual control of throttle, brakes and steering.
The Sender files are intended for use on the Hi-Level board and do not really belong in the Drive-by-wire repository.

Libraries needed are listed below:

ALL Versions ________________________________
* PID by Brett Beauregard
    https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library
    A simple controller calculator (proportional integral derivative) to calculate the error between a desired output and an actual output. Has files **PID_v1**

Version 3 (Arduino Mega) ________________________________
* CAN_BUS_SHIELD by Seeed-Studio
    https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/CAN_BUS_Shield
    Contains CAN_BUS communication protocols and required files such as **mcp_can** and **can-serial**

* Pin Change Interrupt by Nico Hood
    https://github.com/NicoHood/PinChangeInterrupt
    For custom configuration of Arduino pin properties. Has files **PinChangeInterupt**

* MCP48x2 DAC by Jonas Forsberg
    https://github.com/SweBarre/MCP48x2.
    Library for Digital to anolog converter. Has files **MCP48x2**

Version 4 (Arduino Due)  _______________________________________________
* Due CAN and CAN Common by Collin Kidder
    https://github.com/collin80/due_can
    https://github.com/collin80/can_common


## To Install

* Download the **Drive_By_Wire** module into the project parent directory
```
git clone https://github.com/elcano/Drive-by-wire.git
```
* Move into the **Drive_By_Wire** folder
```
cd Drive_By_Wire
```
* Download the required libraries
```
git clone https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_CAN.git
git clone https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library.git
git clone https://github.com/NicoHood/PinChangeInterrupt.git
git clone https://github.com/SweBarre/MCP48x2.git
git clone https://github.com/ivanseidel/DueTimer.git
git clone https://github.com/collin80/can_common.git
git clone https://github.com/collin80/due_can.git
```
* Add the folders above to the IDE directory. In Windows, add the required libraries to: C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Arduino\libraries
* Arduino Due requires additional installation. On the IDE, go to Tools -> Boards -> Boards Manager -> Arduino SAM Boards (32-bits ARM Cortex-M3) 

## Navigating Arduino IDE: 
* **Selecting Board:** Tools -> Board -> Arduino AVR/SAM Boards -> Arduino Mega/Due
* **Selecting Serial Port:** Tools -> Port -> COM (Arduino Mega/Due)
* **Accessing Serial Monitor:** Right-hand Corner -> Select Baud Rate (115200)


## Drive-by-Wire: 
* **Low-level board code with RC control support with existing code for brakes, steering, and throttle.** 

## Test: 
* **Low-level board code with three functions to test each subsystems individually (brakes, steering, throttle).** 
* testBrake(): Activates brakes with 24V via Stop(), Holds brakes with 12V after 800ms via Update(), Releases brakes every ~2 seconds.
* testThrottle(): Gradually increases speed and decreases speed on DACA.
* testSteering(): Changes directions every 3 seconds, moving the linear actuator. 

## Sender: 
* **High-level board code to communicate with low-level board using CAN communication.** 
* Arguments for Function: Each data is reserved for 2 bytes. 
    *   currentSpeed: Controls the speed via the DACA, input: (0 -255).
    *   currentBrake: Apply and updates brakes if necessary, input: (0 - releases brakes, anything above 0 - applies brakes).
    *   currentAngle: Changes direction based on input (may need to calibrate based on sensors), left: 779 (1ms), middle: 722 (1.5ms), right: 639 (1.85ms).
